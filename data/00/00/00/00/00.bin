00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,400
我以违反神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你
I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

39
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,860
很久以前  全知的时间守护者出现了
Long ago, the all-knowing Time-Keepers emerged,

40
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,780
创造并梳理了神圣时间线
creating and organizing the Sacred Timeline.

41
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,990
有时  像你这样的人会偏离道路
Sometimes, people like you veer off the path.

42
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,650
我们称这种人为时间异体
We call those Variants.

43
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,990
劳菲森  你是否认罪
Laufeyson, how do you plead?

44
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,540
对了  我是莫比乌斯特工
I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

45
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,780
你在这里干多久了
How long have you been here?

46
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,030
我不知道  不好说
I don't know. It's hard to say,

47
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,610
时管局的时间流逝不一样
time passes differently here in the TVA.

48
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,280
你们招摇卖弄
Now, you parade about

49
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,740
仿佛你们是宇宙力量的神圣仲裁者
as if you're the divine arbiters of power in the universe.

50
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,240
无限宝石
Infinity Stones?

51
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,150
有人用这些石头当镇纸
Some of the guys use 'em as paperweights.

52
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,610
这是宇宙里最强大的力量吗
Is this the greatest power in the universe?

53
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,650
我不能回去  对吧
I can't go back, can I?

54
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,860
我给不了你救赎
I can't offer you salvation,

55
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,490
但我也许可以给你更好的
but maybe I can offer you something better.

56
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,440
一名在逃时间异体一直在杀害我们的时间卫队
A fugitive Variant's been killing our Minutemen.

57
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,030
你们需要恶作剧之神协助你们阻止他
And you need the God of Mischief to help you stop him?

58
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,280
那为什么选我
Why me?

59
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,070
我们要抓捕的时间异体是
The Variant we're hunting is...

60
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,610
你
You.

61
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,740
许个愿吧
Make a wish.

62
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,860
怎么回事
What's going on?

63
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,940
你们的衣着不对
You guys aren't dressed right.

64
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,950
我...那个...
I... So...

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,070
已找到时间异体  指挥官
Variant detected, Commander.

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,320
行动
Let's move.

67
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,070
我们有些人很当真的
Some of us need this, you know.

68
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,950
尚未发现关联能量  长官
No nexus energy yet, ma'am.

69
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,860
是陷阱  自己小心
It's a trap. Watch your backs!

70
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,240
各位老爷  女士  欢迎
My lords, my ladies, welcome

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,570
谢谢大家加入我们  来到城堡
and thank you for joining us, here at the castle.

72
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,860
请在座位上坐好
Please, settle into your seats

73
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,690
一场大战即将开始
for a great battle is about to commence.

74
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,900
奖品  是我们的公主
The prize? Our princess.

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,280
邪恶会胜利吗  还是我们会等来英雄
Will evil prevail, or are we holding out for a hero?

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,110
指挥官
Commander?

77
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,450
{\an9}Where have all the good men gone And where are all the Gods?

78
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,240
{\an9}Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight...

79
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,150
你在干什么
What are you doing?

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,740
玩玩
Having some fun.

81
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,320
{\an9}Isn't there a white knight Upon a fiery steed?

82
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,860
{\an9}Late at night, I toss and I turn And I dream of what I need

83
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,700
{\an9}I need a hero

84
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,900
{\an9}I'm holding out for a hero Till the end of the night

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
{\an9}He's gotta be strong And he's gotta be fast

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,530
{\an9}And he's gotta be fresh from the fight

87
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,450
{\an9}I need a hero

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,950
{\an9}I'm holding out for a hero 'Till the morning light

89
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,240
{\an9}He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,360
{\an9}And he's gotta be larger than life

91
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,280
{\an9}I need a hero!

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,610
好了  各位  我们来复习一下都学了什么
Okay, y'all, let's review what we've learned.

93
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,860
关联事件分支突破红线会发生什么
What happens when a nexus event branches past red line?

94
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,360
很糟的事
Very bad things.

95
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,990
得了  洛基  究竟是什么
Come on, Loki. What is it?

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,450
那时  时管局便不能重置该关联事件
It's when the TVA can no longer reset a nexus event.

97
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,240
好吗  无聊
Okay? Boring.

98
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,690
对了  那就会导致时间线毁灭
Right. And that would lead to the destruction of the timeline

99
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,400
以及我们所知的现实的崩坏
and the collapse of reality as we know it.

100
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,650
你能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

101
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,030
你是录音  还是活物
Are you a recording? Or are you alive?

102
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,110
算是都是吧
Uh, sorta both.

103
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,400
小心点  怎么这么没礼貌
Watch it! Where's your manners?

104
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,700
别闹了
Quit it!

105
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,400
那可不好  混蛋
That is not nice. Jerk.

106
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,280
-你不能躲...  -训练得还顺利吗
- You can't hide... - Training goin' well?

107
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,570
-嗯  -那是我的摩托艇杂志吗
- Yeah. - Is that my jet ski magazine?

108
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,820
放下吧  来  换上装备
Put it down. Come on. Gear up.

109
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,320
发生了袭击  我们走
There's been an attack. Let's go.

110
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,360
穿上
Put it on.

111
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,200
很好  嗯  很帅
Good. Yeah. Smart.

112
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,440
C20和她的团队在跳入
C-20 and her team went dark

113
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,200
1985年分支后不就便失联
shortly after they jumped into the 1985 branch.

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,530
所有迹象均表明再次发生了伏击
All signs point to another ambush.

115
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,410
我们已获取了足够多的即刻气场
We've grabbed enough temporal aura

116
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,570
可以知道那是我们找的洛基时间异体
to know it's our Loki Variant.

117
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,950
但是哪种洛基  仍不清楚
But which kind of Loki, remains unknown.

118
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,240
肯定是不怎么样的那种  我们说清楚
They're the lesser kind, to be clear.

119
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,860
给我看看你外套后面
Let me see the back of that jacket.

120
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,780
真含蓄  好啊
Very subtle. Well done.

121
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,650
我不希望有人忘记你的身份
I don't want anybody out there to forget what you are.

122
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,440
你逮住一个杀人犯的唯一希望吗
Your only hope of capturing a murderer?

123
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,570
不  是一个宇宙错误
No. A cosmic mistake.

124
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,110
-够了  -真会说
- That's enough. - Lovely.

125
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,240
是这样的
Here's the deal.

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,610
我们进入时间分支后
When we get out on the branch,

127
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,690
可不单单是要找一个时间罪犯
we're not just looking for a Time Criminal.

128
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,110
而是要找一个洛基
We're looking for a Loki.

129
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,450
这家伙的一个异体
A variation of this guy.

130
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,070
这种人我们应该都很熟悉了
A type we should all be very familiar with,

131
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,320
因为时管局删除过很多这种人
because the TVA has pruned a lotta these guys,

132
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,490
几乎超过其他所有时间异体
almost more than any other Variant.

133
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,740
没有任何两个是一样的
And no two are alike.

134
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,110
虽然外表稍有变化  也有的变化很大
Slight differences in appearances, or not so slight.

135
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,740
能力也不一样  但其能力一般包括
Different powers, although, powers, generally include

136
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,490
变形  幻觉投射  还有我最喜欢的
shape-shifting, illusion-projection, and my favorite...

137
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,990
分身
Duplication-casting.

138
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,650
幻觉投射
Illusion-projection.

139
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,820
不  这两种能力其实完全不同
No, they're two completely different powers, actually.

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,900
怎么说
How?

141
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,150
幻觉投射需要
Illusion-projection involves

142
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,320
细致地描绘一个非己的幻象
depicting a detailed image from outside oneself,

143
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,150
在外部世界里可以观察到
which is perceptible in the external world,

144
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,740
而分身则要一丝不差地
whereas duplication-casting entails recreating

145
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,150
重现目前状况下的自己的身体
an exact facsimile of one's own body in its present circumstance,

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,700
相当于其分子结构的真实的全息镜像
which acts as a true holographic mirror of its molecular structure.

147
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,780
但你们已经知道了
But you already knew that.

148
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,950
好  别激动  我们知道了
Okay, take a breath. Noted.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,900
我们分为两队
We're gonna break into two teams,

150
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,320
包括我和洛基教授
including myself and Professor Loki.

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,280
为什么
Why?

152
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,740
因为不管这个时间异体是谁
Because whoever this Variant is,

153
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,150
我们一直没能找到他
we haven't been able to find him.

154
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,740
所以我们叫上一位专家吧
So let's bring in an expert.

155
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,240
就是我
That's me.

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,530
-我有武器吗  -没有
- Do I get a weapon? - Nah.

157
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,400
我能恢复魔法  就没人担心这个吗
Well, I'll have my magic back. Is no one concerned about that?

158
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,150
-担心什么  -我背叛你
- Of what? - Me betraying you.

159
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,570
-不担心  -为什么
- No. - Why not?

160
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,900
你已经知道我们能抓住你
Because you already know that we can catch you.

161
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,110
背叛我们
And how's betraying us

162
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,780
怎么可能让你更接近时间守护者
gonna get you any closer to the Time-Keepers?

163
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,400
我可以见到时间守护者吗
An audience with the Time-Keepers is on the table?

164
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,110
保持专注
Keep that focus.

165
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,950
关联信号峰值已定位  长官
Apex of nexus signature located, ma'am.

166
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,820
我问问你
Let me ask you this,

167
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,860
我们怎么不穿回袭击发生前
why don't we just travel back to before the attack,

168
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,320
去时间异体刚到的时间
when the Variant first arrives?

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,360
关联事件会降低时间流稳定性
Nexus events destabilize the time flow.

170
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,690
这支时间分支仍在改变  发展
This branch is still changing and growing,

171
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,690
所以你得按实际时间到场
so you gotta show up in real time.

172
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,990
你到底看没看让你看的那些训练视频
Did you watch any of the training videos you were supposed to?

173
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,030
我已经尽量忍着看了
Well, as many as I could stand.

174
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,900
你们时管局的宣传片真让人厌倦
Your TVA propaganda is exhausting.

175
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,280
这个是干什么的
And what do these do?

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,740
重置设备  可删除一条分支时间线受影响的范围
Reset charges prune the affected radius of a branched timeline,

177
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,440
让时间治愈其伤口
allowing time to heal all its wounds.

178
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,690
对了  这听上去就像是用冠冕堂皇地方式
Which, by the way, sounds like a nice way

179
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,200
说销毁周围的一切
of saying disintegrate everything in its vicinity.

180
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,610
他掌握了
He's on it.

181
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,200
我看视频了
I watched the videos.

182
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
看了一些吧
I mean, some of them.

183
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,820
他还劫持人质了吗
So he's taking hostages now?

184
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,320
时间异体以前从未劫持过人质
The Variant's never taken a hostage before.

185
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,700
或许他行动升级了
Maybe he's upping his game.

186
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,990
或是他删了她
Or he pruned her.

187
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,490
一个洛基不可能偷袭C20
A Loki couldn't have gotten the jump on C-20.

188
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,150
我觉得你是低估了...
I think you underestimate, actually...

189
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,780
散开  找她
Fan out and search for her.

190
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,780
快点
And hurry up,

191
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,940
我们离红线只有三个单位了
because we're at three units until red line.

192
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,240
-走吧  她说得对  -走
- Let's go. She's right. - Come on.

193
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,990
等等
Wait...

194
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,030
如果你们出帐篷  会落得像他们一样
If you leave this tent, you'll end up like them.

195
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,990
你看到了什么
What do you see?

196
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,530
计谋
I see a scheme,

197
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,070
我在这计谋里看到了自己
and in that scheme, I see myself.

198
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,860
我们阿斯加德有句俗语
We have a saying in Asgard,

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,610
"见到狼的耳朵  狼的牙也不远了"
"Where there are wolf's ears, wolf's teeth are near."

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,740
就是说  要注意周边情况
It means to be aware of your surroundings.

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,530
这很荒唐  因为我的族人
Which is absurd, because my people are,

202
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,110
天性就是好骗的傻瓜
by nature, gullible fools.

203
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,820
而我  恶作剧之神
A trait that I, the God of Mischief,

204
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,240
光凭注意听  就屡次利用了这个特征
exploited time and time again simply by listening.

205
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,490
我的牙很尖  但我的耳朵更尖
My teeth were sharp, but my ears even sharper.

206
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,360
我们要没时间了  莫比乌斯
We're running out of time, Mobius.

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,530
等一下  给他个机会
Hold it. Just give him a chance.

208
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,990
你们让我想到了他们
You remind me of them.

209
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,150
时间变异管理局
The Time Variance Authority

210
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,650
和阿斯加德的神们都一样
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

211
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,150
因权力而迷醉  对真相视而不见
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

212
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,450
你们低估的人会吞噬你们
Those you underestimate will devour you.

213
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,030
你们低估我
You underestimate me,

214
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,150
你们也低估了这个不怎么样的洛基
just as you underestimate this lesser Loki.

215
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,400
所以  你们才一次次地步入狼口
Which is why, you walk into one wolf's mouth after another.

216
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,070
两个单位了  他在浪费我们的时间
Two units. He is wasting our time.

217
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,990
好了  洛基  长话短说
Okay. Come on, Loki, make a long story short.

218
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,320
我们得去找C20
We need to look for C-20.

219
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,280
那正是时间异体希望你们做的事
That's exactly what the Variant wants you to do.

220
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,360
这是陷阱  他在帐篷外等你们呢
It's a trap. He's waiting for you outside this tent.

221
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,690
要我去安装重置设备吗
Should I secure the reset charges?

222
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,650
不  他要的是我  我是他计划的关键
No. He wants me. I'm the key to his plan.

223
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,150
-他知道我比他强  -一个单位多了
- He knows that I'm stronger. - Almost one unit.

224
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,400
而且他认为我们联手
And he rightly believes that together

225
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,150
就能夺取时管局的大权  这是对的
we can overthrow and rule the TVA.

226
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,280
但那不是我想要的  我有了新的目标
But that's not what I want. I have a new purpose.

227
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,900
我是神圣时间线的仆人
I'm a servant of the Sacred Timeline.

228
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,900
现在我了解了他的策略
And knowing what I now know about his tactics,

229
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,450
我可以把时间异体交给你们
I can deliver you the Variant,

230
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,950
但我需要保证
but I need assurances.

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,990
什么保证
Yeah?

232
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,990
保证我完成工作后
Assurances that I won't be completely disintegrated

233
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,650
不会马上被消灭
the moment the job has been done.

234
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,030
好吧
Right...

235
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,650
而且我们得马上去找时间守护者
And we'll need to speak to the Time-Keepers at once.

236
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,780
他们面临的危险比我们想的要大
They're in graver danger than we realized.

237
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,650
他在撒谎  在耍诡计
He's lying. Just playing games.

238
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,990
外面没人
There's no one out there.

239
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,320
重置时间线
Reset the timeline.

240
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,110
你刚刚真差点骗过了我
You had me for a second.

241
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,030
我的耳朵也很尖
My ears are sharp too.

242
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,530
只有我觉得这间办公室
Is it just me, or does this office

243
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,240
越来越堂皇了吗
keep getting better and better?

244
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,900
那个雪球你哪弄来的
Where'd you get that one, the snow globe?

245
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,190
我好喜欢
I love those.

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,280
我不记得拿过那个箱子回来
I don't remember bringing back that case.

247
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,740
你不是唯一为我工作的分析师
You're not the only analyst working for me.

248
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,070
但你觉得我是你最喜欢的那个吗
But, would you say, maybe, I'm your favorite one?

249
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,150
而且凭什么你可以留着所有
And why do you get to keep all the trophies

250
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,650
我办案的战利品
from my cases in here?

251
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,780
你就不觉得我会希望那双旱冰鞋
You don't think I'd love having that roller skate there

252
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,490
装点我的隔间吗
sprucing up my cubicle?

253
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,150
因为是我审批任务
Because I approve the missions.

254
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,900
有道理
Good point.

255
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,150
说起来  我们谈谈你刚搞砸的那个吧
Speaking of which, let's talk about the one you just botched.

256
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,570
我们谈话时  你可能需要这个
You might need this for our discussion.

257
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,200
希望是双份的
I hope it's a double.

258
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,400
这个时间异体
This Variant is...

259
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,860
"抗命  顽固  难以预料"
"Insubordinate, stubborn, unpredictable."

260
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,950
听上去像我认识的另一个人呢
Sounds like someone else I know.

261
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,450
我还在想  这听上去像我认识的一个人
I was just thinking it sounds like someone I know.

262
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,320
-莫比乌斯  -怎么了
- Mobius? - What?

263
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,320
本来就有杯痕了
Those rings were already there.

264
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,610
都是你留下的
And they're all from you.

265
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,490
或许是你另一个最喜欢的分析师留下的呢
Maybe it's from your other favorite analyst.

266
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,530
听着  萝雯娜  很抱歉
Listen, Ravonna, I'm sorry.

267
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,030
我知道
I realize that my, you know,

268
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,690
我对待这个洛基的方式很受争议  但是
methods with this Loki are controversial, but...

269
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,740
把一个危险时间异体带去出勤是有争议
Towing a dangerous Variant into the field is controversial.

270
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,610
对  今天的进展并没如我预料的那般好
Yeah, it didn't go exactly the way I wanted it to today,

271
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,110
但我们知道了一件事
but here's what we did find out.

272
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,240
那个时间异体喜欢拖时间
The Variant likes to stall for time,

273
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,690
最终  我们会发现另一个做同样的事
and, eventually, we'll catch the other one doing the same thing.

274
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,860
因为了解这个洛基  能帮我接近
Because understanding this Loki helps me get closer

275
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,950
我们在追的那个  是吧
to the one we're chasing. Right?

276
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,940
听着  我知道你喜欢坏掉的东西
Look, I know you have a soft spot for broken things.

277
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,360
-我才不呢  -你就是
- I don't think so. - Yes, you do.

278
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,280
但洛基是个邪恶  爱撒谎的祸害
But Loki is an evil, lying scourge.

279
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,030
他在神圣时间线上就是这样的角色
That is the part he plays on the Sacred Timeline.

280
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,360
或许他想变变呢
Maybe he wants to mix it up.

281
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,530
有时一直扮演一个角色令人厌烦
Sometimes you get tired of playing the same part.

282
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,900
有没有这个可能  他能改变
Is that possible? He can change?

283
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,150
除非时间守护者下令
Not unless the Time-Keepers decree it.

284
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,240
那便可能
And then, it shall be so.

285
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,450
那时间守护者怎么样了
And how are the old Time-Keepers?

286
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,990
你觉得呢
How do you think?

287
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,190
我不知道  因为我没见过他们
I don't know. 'Cause I've never met 'em.

288
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
幸好  不过  我不该这么说
Thankfully. Although, I shouldn't say that.

289
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,150
那个看上去...
That one looks...

290
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,700
时间守护者在密切关注此案的方方面面
The Time-Keepers are monitoring every aspect of this case.

291
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,450
我从未见过他们这么关切
I've never seen them so involved.

292
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,610
他们想要那个时间异体被抓住
They want that Variant caught.

293
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,740
我也是
So do I.

294
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,940
这是你跟这个洛基的最后机会了
And this is the last chance you're gonna get with this Loki.

295
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,360
好啊  我就需要一个机会
Great, that's all I need.

296
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,070
谢谢  伦斯雷尔
Thank you, R Slayer.

297
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
我不记得这笔
I don't remember this.

298
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,400
这是你的另一个分析师的吧
This must be from that analyst you keep on the side.

299
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,700
保持专注
Stay focused.

300
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,320
眼睛看路
Eyes on the road.

301
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,400
莫比乌斯
Mobius?

302
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,400
我差点出门了
I was almost gone.

303
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,030
你真相信这个时间异体吗
You really believe in this Variant?

304
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,190
幸好  他的自信够我们俩人用了
Luckily, he believes in himself enough for the both of us.

305
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,280
如果不行  我亲手删了他
And, hey, if it doesn't work, I'll delete him myself.

306
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,700
他可傲慢了
He's really arrogant.

307
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,700
你可能在想  任务时发生了什么
You're probably wondering what happened out on the mission.

308
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,530
那是你抓洛基的第一课
That was your first lesson in catching a Loki.

309
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,570
料到可以预料的
Expect the expected.

310
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,400
做恶作剧之神的一半乐趣
See, half the fun of being a trickster

311
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,610
就在于知道大家都知道你是恶作剧之神
is knowing everyone knows you're a trickster, and then,

312
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,030
你的很多恶作剧就是利用了
many of your tricks can come from exploiting the fact

313
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,740
-你知道他们知道...  -闭嘴吧
- that you know that they know... - Okay. Just shut up!

314
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,440
拜托了  我在电梯里认识的那家伙呢
Please. What happened to the guy I met on the elevator?

315
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,240
那个不喜欢说话的  记得他吗
Who didn't like to talk. Remember him?

316
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,280
现在我不得不应付
Now I'm stuck with this guy

317
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,200
一个开口闭口都是洛基如何的话痨
who won't stop yacking away about what makes a Loki tick!

318
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,440
什么  那不正是我的作用吗
What? Isn't that precisely why I'm here?

319
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,030
不  我不在乎你是什么样的
No. I don't care what makes you tick.

320
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,150
你要帮我抓住那个更厉害的你自己
You're here to help me catch the superior version of yourself.

321
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,990
-仅此而已  -等等
- That's it! - Hang on.

322
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,070
"更厉害"这个词不对吧
I'm not sure "superior" is actually quite the right word.

323
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,240
看  出现了  就这个
See? There it is. Right there.

324
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,900
我愚蠢地认为
I believed, stupidly,

325
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,990
渴求认可的不安感
that insecure need for validation

326
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,650
能激励你找到那个杀人犯
would motivate you to find the killer.

327
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,610
不是因为你在乎时管局的任务  或想当英雄
Not 'cause you care about the TVA mission or bein' a hero,

328
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,740
而是因为你知道  这个时间异体
but because you know this Variant

329
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,450
比你厉害  而你受不了
is better than you and you can't take it.

330
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,450
好啊
Very nice.

331
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,320
你真以为可以操纵我
I mean, it is adorable that you think

332
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,030
真是可爱
you could possibly manipulate me.

333
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,440
我先了你十步
I'm ten steps ahead of you.

334
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,030
我一直在玩我自己的游戏
I've been playing a game of my own all along.

335
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,690
什么  施展魅力  好得到时间守护者的接见
What, charm your way in front of the Time-Keepers,

336
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,650
欺骗他们  然后控制时管局吗
hustle them, and seize control of the TVA?

337
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,070
差不多是这样吗
Am I getting warm?

338
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,530
史上最可靠的撒谎精的背叛
A double cross by history's most reliable liar.

339
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,570
好吧  那你为什么在里面替我做担保
Okay. Why are you in there sticking your neck out for me?

340
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,940
我给你两个选择
I'll give you two options,

341
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,690
随你信哪个都行
and you can believe whichever one you want.

342
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,150
A  因为我看到了一个在寒风中瑟瑟发抖的
A, because I see a scared little boy,

343
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,690
被吓坏的小男孩
shivering in the cold.

344
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,990
你不禁可怜那小冰孩
And you kinda feel bad for that ice runt.

345
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,690
B  我就是想抓住他
Or B, I just wanna catch this guy,

346
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
你想听什么  我就说什么
and I'll tell you whatever I need to tell you.

347
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,240
我不需要你的同情
I don't need your sympathy.

348
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,110
很好  因为我剩的不多了
Good, 'cause I'm runnin' out of it.

349
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,650
你想干什么  你接下来的操纵...
What's this? Next step of your manipulation...

350
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,150
不  这是最后一步  你的最后机会
This is the final step. Your last chance.

351
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,110
那我孤注一掷的最后机会需要什么
Oh, and what does my desperate last chance require?

352
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,070
工作
Work.

353
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,030
工作
Work?

354
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,570
我需要你翻阅
I need you to go over each

355
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,530
时间异体的所有案卷
and every one of the Variant's case files,

356
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,440
然后给出你的...怎么说呢
and then, give me your... How do I put it?

357
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,820
你独特的洛基见解
Your unique Loki perspective.

358
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,150
谁知道呢  或许我们遗漏了什么
And who knows? Maybe there's something that we missed.

359
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,610
你们这么蠢  八成遗漏了很多
Well, you're idiots. I suspect you probably missed a lot.

360
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,490
所以幸好我还有你  还有一阵
That's why I'm lucky I got ya for a little bit longer.

361
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,940
你就坐在这张桌子上
Let me park ya at this desk.

362
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,570
别怕好好投入工作中
And don't be afraid to really lean into this work.

363
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,820
教你个好办法
Here's a good trick for you.

364
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,780
假装你的性命系于此
Pretend your life depends on it.

365
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,110
我去拿点零食
I'm gonna get a snack.

366
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,400
天啊
Oh, my goodness.

367
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,570
别告诉我时间异体伏击
Don't tell me the Variant ambushed

368
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,650
并杀害了又一支时间卫队
and killed another team of Minutemen.

369
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,280
还偷了他们的重置设备
And stole their reset charge as well.

370
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,570
你好
Hello?

371
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,240
需要帮助吗
Can I help you?

372
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,030
是  我在为时管局办要事
Yes. I'm on some important TVA business.

373
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,900
跟进一次外勤行动  你了解的
Follow-up to a field mission. You know how it goes.

374
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,360
我们在靠近峰值时红线了
We red lined near the apex, and...

375
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,450
那可不是好事
Well, it's never good.

376
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,690
我想调阅所有关于
Um, I'd like all files pertaining

377
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,990
时管局成立的档案  谢谢
to the creation of the TVA, please.

378
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,280
那是机密
Those are classified.

379
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,570
好吧  那我要所有
Okay. I'd like all files pertaining

380
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,110
关于时间初始的文件
to the beginning of time then.

381
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,990
-那是机密  -好  那时间终结呢
- Those are classified. - Okay, the end of time.

382
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,900
-那是机密  -好吧  我能调阅哪些文件
- Those are classified. - Okay, what files can I have?

383
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,530
阅读快乐
Happy reading.

384
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,490
我有发现
I found something.

385
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,610
不  我说了"档案没读完前  别来烦我"
No, I said, "Don't bother me until you've read all the files."

386
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,110
-我读完了  -所有吗
- I have. - Every file?

387
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,360
-是的  -跟时间异体有关的
- Yes. - Pertaining to the Variant?

388
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,900
答案不在档案里  在时间线上
The answer isn't in the files, it's on the timeline.

389
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,610
他躲在了天启里
He's hiding in apocalypses.

390
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,570
哪个天启
Which apocalypse?

391
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,950
历史上的哪个时间点  有好多天启呢
Any time in history? There's, like, a million of 'em.

392
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,200
诸神黄昏  你知道吗
Ragnarok. Are you familiar?

393
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,040
知道  阿斯加德和大部分臣民的毁灭
Yes. The destruction of Asgard and most of its people.

394
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,990
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,030
是啊  很悲哀
Yes, very sad.

396
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,360
反正  我想到了件事
Anyway, it got me thinking...

397
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,490
讲
Go ahead.

398
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,490
关联事件
Nexus events

399
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,240
就是有人做了
happen when someone does something

400
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,740
他们不该做的事  是吧
they're not supposed to do, right?

401
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,490
要比那复杂些  但对
Well, it's a little more complicated, but, yeah.

402
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,490
很好  然后他们不该做的那件事
Great. And then that thing they're not supposed to do,

403
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,820
又连带出了各种其他
cascades into a whole range of other things

404
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,990
本不该发生的事
that aren't supposed to happen.

405
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,990
如此种种  直到最终
And so on and so forth, until eventually,

406
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,070
分支出了新时间线  是吧
a new timeline branches. Yes?

407
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,610
预定结果的混乱变化
Chaotic alterations of a predetermined outcome.

408
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,320
-对啊  那么假设  -你干什么
- Exactly. So, let's just say... - What are you doing?

409
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,780
-你的沙拉  是阿斯加德  -不
- ...your salad is Asgard in this scenario. - No.

410
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,860
那不是阿斯加德  是我的午餐
It's not Asgard, that's my lunch.

411
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,110
就是个比喻  等等的
It's a metaphor. Just hang in there.

412
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,860
-我还想吃沙拉呢  -我可以去阿斯加德
- I want that salad. - And I could go down to Asgard

413
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,240
赶在诸神黄昏导致它完全被摧毁之前
before Ragnarok causes its complete destruction

414
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,900
我可以随意做任何事
and I could do anything I wanted.

415
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,450
我可以  比如说
I could, let's say,

416
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,610
把绿巨人推下彩虹桥
push the Hulk off the Rainbow Bridge.

417
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,940
-他摔下去了  -盐是绿巨人吗
- There he goes. - The salt's Hulk?

418
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,200
我还可以...
And I could also...

419
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,990
在王宫纵火
Set fire to the palace.

420
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,240
不  住手  别给王宫纵火
No, just stop. Don't set fire to the palace.

421
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,240
我想做什么都行  那都不重要
I can do whatever I want to do, and it would never matter.

422
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,610
那不会有违钦定的时间线  因为
It wouldn't go against the dictates of the timeline because...

423
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,990
-不好意思  -天啊
- Excuse me? - Oh, god!

424
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,650
-是你  -见到你很高兴
- You! - Nice to see you.

425
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,570
借我用用  谢谢
I just need this for a second. Thanks.

426
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,490
因为  天启要来了
Because the apocalypse is coming.

427
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,220
诸神黄昏  不管我做什么
Ragnarok, Surtur will destroy Asgard

428
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,780
苏尔特尔都会毁灭阿斯加德
no matter what I do.

429
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,900
不  别
No, don't do...

430
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,280
-那是天启  -那是天启吗
- There's the apocalypse. - That's the apocalypse?

431
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,240
诸神黄昏毁灭了盐
Ragnarok obliterates the salt.

432
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,110
诸神黄昏
Ragnarok.

433
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,030
就是这样
There it is.

434
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,690
我在看什么
What am I lookin' at?

435
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,360
好吧  这个比喻很笨拙  但你明白我的意思吧
Okay, it was a clumsy metaphor. But you see what I mean.

436
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,570
无所谓  可以是任何一个天启
It doesn't matter. It could be any apocalypse.

437
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,110
可以是海啸  陨石
It could be a tidal wave. It could be a meteor.

438
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,110
火山爆发  超新星爆炸
It could be a volcano, a supernova.

439
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,440
如果你周边的一切
If everything and everyone around you

440
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,490
都注定马上要毁灭
is destined for imminent destruction,

441
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,570
那我说什么  做什么都无所谓了
then nothing that I say or do will matter,

442
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,030
因为时间线不会分支
because the timeline's not gonna branch.

443
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,900
因为它会被毁灭
'Cause it gets destroyed.

444
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,320
因此  时间异体可以藏在天启里
Hence, the Variant could be hiding in the apocalypse

445
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,280
随心所欲  我们也无从察觉
and do whatever he wants, and we wouldn't know!

446
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,230
不赖
Not bad.

447
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,080
带我去一场真天启  比如诸神黄昏
Take me to a real apocalypse, to Ragnarok,

448
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,790
我能让你看到
I'll show you.

449
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,110
好啊  那样你就能跑回家乡了吗  别想
Yeah. So you can run away back to your homeland? No.

450
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,900
不  我不回家  我们去哪都行
No, I'm not going home. We can go anywhere.

451
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,580
我都不会带你去散步
I'm not taking you for a stroll along the promenade,

452
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,070
别说去天启了
much less an apocalypse.

453
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,770
莫比乌斯  拜托
Oh, Mobius, come on!

454
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,110
能出什么岔子
What could possibly go wrong?

455
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,800
我们的理论已经过了检验
We gotta properly test this theory.

456
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,310
我说个有趣理论吧
Well, here's a fun theory.

457
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,090
你把我引去出外勤  然后背后捅我刀子
You lure me out into the field, and stab me in the back.

458
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,230
这个理论我可不想测试
And that's a theory I don't wanna test.

459
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,100
我绝不会从背后捅任何人刀子
I'd never stab anyone in the back.

460
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,880
那样背叛太无聊了
That's such a boring form of betrayal.

461
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,070
洛基  我研究过基本上你人生的每个时刻
Loki, I've studied almost every moment of your entire life.

462
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,390
你真的背后捅刀有50多次了
You've literally stabbed people in the back, like, 50 times.

463
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,600
那我再不会那么做了  都老套了
Well, I'd never do it again, because it got old.

464
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,340
好吧
Okay.

465
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,310
这样吧  你不信任我  你信任这个
Okay, look, you don't trust me, you can trust one thing.

466
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,390
我喜欢说对
I love to be right.

467
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,550
-我们到了  -快开始了
- Here we go. - Shh, any minute now.

468
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,270
然后这座小镇就会被彻底毁灭
Until this entire town is wiped off the face of this planet.

469
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,050
想想看  那么多火山灰
Imagine. All that volcanic ash...

470
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,440
我知道  我们也别太乐呵了
I know. We don't want to get too giddy.

471
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,930
拜托  这多酷
Oh, come on! It's cool.

472
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,030
的确  但这样太不体面
No, it is cool, but it's just not in good taste because...

473
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,230
他们反正也要死了
They're all gonna die anyway.

474
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,630
我知道  听好
I know. Now listen,

475
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,560
我会监视时空器  看是否有异变能量
I'm gonna watch the TemPad for any variance energy.

476
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
-好  -我们得万分小心
- Okay. - Okay, because we gotta be careful.

477
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,720
如果你错了  你很可能是错的
If you're wrong, and there's a good chance you are,

478
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,460
那我们做的事  就可能引发严重分支
anything we do can create a huge branch.

479
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,380
莫比乌斯  你把世界末日都说得那么无聊
Oh, Mobius! You make even the end of the world sound boring.

480
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,920
听好了  我们本不该来的
Listen! Okay, we're not meant to be here.

481
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,310
-好吗  -好
- Okay? - Okay.

482
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,490
我们做的任何事  都可能影响历史进程
Anything we do can impact the course of history.

483
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,010
-你明白吗  -嗯
- Do you get that? - Yes. Yes.

484
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,580
所以我们先来些很小的扰动
So we're gonna start with very small disturbances.

485
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,790
-很小  -你会学鸟叫吗
- Very small. - Can you make bird noises?

486
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,480
鸟叫
Bird noises?

487
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,290
对  鸟叫  就那种啾啾声
Yeah. Bird noises. Like some, like, whooshing noises.

488
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,280
洛基  洛基
Loki! Loki!

489
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,150
走吧
Go!

490
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,210
自由了  我长角的朋友  你们自由了
Be free, my horned-friends, be free!

491
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,920
我们是从未来来吧
We are from the future, right?

492
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,000
时管局算什么  它来自未来吧
What is the TVA? I mean, it's from the future.

493
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,040
听上去像  挺有未来感的
It sounds from the future. It's pretty future-y.

494
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,610
时间正好
Right on cue!

495
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,260
趁还有机会  享受你们的最后一餐吧
Enjoy your last meal while you can!

496
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,370
什么都不重要
Nothing matters!

497
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,910
所有一切都不会有后果
Nothing has any consequence!

498
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,290
趁你还有机会跳舞吧
Dance while you still can!

499
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,420
怎么样
How'd we do?

500
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,730
难以置信  异变能量为零
I don't believe it. Zero variance energy.

501
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,520
时间线并未分支
No branching in the timeline.

502
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,870
时管局绝不会知道我们来过
The TVA would never even know we were here.

503
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,410
如果是我  我就会藏在这样的地方
If it were me, this is where I would hide.

504
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,890
末日  时间异体一直在伏击我们的士兵后
Doomsdays. The Variant's been ambushing our soldiers

505
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,740
躲进末日里掩藏行踪
and hiding out in doomsdays to cover his tracks.

506
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,770
-不客气哦  -嗯
- You're welcome. - Yeah.

507
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,820
但这理论要想成立  这些灾难必须是
But in order for this theory to hold, the disasters have to be

508
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,980
自然的  突然的  毫无预警的  无人生还的
naturally-occurring, sudden, no warning, no survivors.

509
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,060
-能有多少这样的灾难  -我不知道
- How many of those disasters could there possibily be? - I don't know.

510
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,210
我们查查看
We're gonna find out.

511
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,260
来  我们走走
Come on, let's take a walk.

512
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,510
对了  你桌上的那本杂志
By the way, at your desk, that magazine?

513
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,990
嗯  摩托艇的那个吗
Yeah. The one on jet skis?

514
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,850
嗯
Yes.

515
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,810
你为什么有那个
Why do you have that?

516
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,320
因为那个很棒
Because they're awesome.

517
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,160
-大概是吧  -嗯
- I suppose they are. - Yeah.

518
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,030
有些东西...
You know, some things...

519
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,540
其实  历史上大部分东西都很蠢
Actually, most things in history are kinda dumb,

520
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,390
一切最终都会毁灭
and everything gets ruined eventually.

521
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:20,300
但1990年代初  在那么美好的一小段时光里
But in the early 1990s, for a brief, shining moment,

522
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,660
形态和功能完美的结合了
there was a beautiful union of form and function,

523
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,560
我们称之为摩托艇
which we call the jet ski,

524
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,890
任何讲理的人都不会有异议
and a reasonable man cannot differ.

525
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,570
你骑过吗
You ever been on one?

526
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,320
没有
No... No.

527
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,000
时管局特工在神圣时间线上骑摩托艇
I think a TVA agent showing up on a jet ski on the Sacred Timeline,

528
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,070
那肯定会制造分支
that would create a branch for sure.

529
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,300
但会很好玩的
It'd be fun, though.

530
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,800
是啊  会很好玩
Yeah, it'd be really fun.

531
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,650
那为什么要看呢
So, why read about them?

532
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,980
提醒我  我们在为何而战
Just helps remind me of what we're fighting for.

533
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,930
你真相信这些东西  是吗
I mean, you really believe in all this stuff, don't you?

534
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,100
我不去纠结"信不信"
I don't get hung up on, "Believe, not believe."

535
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,240
我就接受事实
I just accept what is.

536
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,250
-三只魔法蜥蜴  -是时间守护者
- Three magic lizards... - Time-Keepers.

537
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,070
-创造了时管局和它的所有员工  -对
- ...created the TVA, and everyone in it... - Right.

538
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,010
-包括你  -包括我
- ...including you? - Including me.

539
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,920
每次我开始钦佩你的聪明才智
You see, every time I start to admire your intelligence,

540
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,740
你就说这种话
you say something like that.

541
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,580
好吧  那是谁创造了你  洛基
Okay, who created you, Loki?

542
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,970
约顿海姆的一个冰巨人
A Frost Giant of Jotunheim.

543
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,160
谁养大了你
And who raised you?

544
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,840
阿斯加德的奥丁
Odin of Asgard.

545
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,230
奥丁  众神之父
Odin, God of the Heavens.

546
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,890
阿斯加德  群星之域  神秘国度
Asgard, mystical realm, beyond the stars.

547
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,910
-冰巨人  听听你在说什么  -那不一样
- Frost Giants. Listen to yourself... - It's not the same.

548
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,930
-那完全不一样  -不
- It's completely different. - No.

549
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,660
-这不是一回事  -其实就是一回事
- It's not the same. - It's exactly the same thing.

550
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,560
因为如果你仔细去想  我们都是哪来的
Because if you think too hard about where any of us came from,

551
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,500
我们究竟是谁  听上去都很荒唐
who we truly are, it sounds kinda ridiculous.

552
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,210
存在就是混乱
Existence is chaos.

553
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,390
一切都没道理  我们就会想办法去解释
Nothing makes any sense, so we try to make some sense of it.

554
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,330
我很幸运
And I'm just lucky that

555
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,170
我降生的混乱  给了我这一切
the chaos I emerged into gave me all this...

556
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,850
我的光荣使命
My own glorious purpose.

557
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,450
因为时管局是我的生命
'Cause the TVA is my life.

558
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,760
它是真的  因为我相信它
And it's real because I believe it's real.

559
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,410
好吧  你相信它是真的
Fair enough. You believe it's real.

560
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,180
对
Yeah.

561
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,500
所以一切都是既定的
So everything is written.

562
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,860
过去  现在  未来
Past, present, future.

563
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,890
根本不存在自由意志
There's no such thing as free will.

564
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,500
这么说过于简单了
Well, I mean, you know, it's an oversimplification...

565
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,840
那么事实上  可以说
So, in fact, in a way,

566
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,050
在时管局的你和我
you and I here at the TVA,

567
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,030
我们是唯一自由的人
we're the only ones who are actually free.

568
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,520
你想说什么  洛基
Where are you going with this, Loki?

569
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,140
那要怎么结束
How does it all end?

570
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,070
那还在研究
That's a work in progress.

571
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,330
那些懒惰的时间守护者  他们还等什么
Oh, those lazy Time-Keepers. What are they waiting for?

572
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,340
恰恰相反
Au contraire.

573
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,580
不  因为我们守护之前的发生的一切
No. Because while we protect what came before,

574
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,510
他们在自己的小房间里埋头苦干
they're toiling away in their chamber,

575
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,940
把尾声从无限的时间分支中解开
untangling the epilogue from its infinite branches.

576
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,230
这样啊  那等他们做完之后  会怎样呢
I see. So, when they're finished, what happens then?

577
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,020
我们也就忙完了
So are we.

578
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,340
不再有关联事件
No more nexus events.

579
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,340
只有秩序
Just order.

580
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,920
我们在时间的尽头和平相见
And we meet in peace at the end of time.

581
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,410
不错吧
Nice, right?

582
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,850
只有秩序
Only order?

583
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,050
没有混乱吗  听起来好无聊
No chaos? It sounds boring.

584
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,940
你肯定觉得无聊
I'm sure it does to you.

585
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,520
你说我是被吓坏的小男孩
You called me a scared little boy.

586
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,260
我用各种称呼叫过你
I called you a lotta things.

587
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,090
没错
You did.

588
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,560
但你错了
You're wrong, though.

589
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,390
我知道一些小孩不知道的道理
You see, I know something children don't.

590
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,490
什么道理
What's that?

591
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,590
没有真正的坏人
That no one bad is ever truly bad.

592
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
也没有真正的好人
And no one good is ever truly good.

593
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,050
被吓坏的小男孩
Scared little boy.

594
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,890
是啊  那很瞧不起人
Yes, it was quite patronizing.

595
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,580
我觉得有点过分
I thought it was a bit too far, actually.

596
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,720
你非常聪明
You're very clever.

597
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:40,930
我知道
I know.

598
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,920
时间异体在一处旧犯罪现场留下了点东西
The Variant left something behind at an old crime scene.

599
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,020
一座大教堂  一个糖果盒
A cathedral. A candy box.

600
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,220
一个明显不符合时代的物件
An obvious anachronism.

601
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,970
我把它交给了分析师  但他们查不出什么
I gave it to Analysis, but they couldn't find anything real.

602
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,610
-这有什么关系  -因为现在有两个变量
- Why does that matter? - 'Cause now we have two variables.

603
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
天启级别的自然灾害和
Apocalyptic natural disasters and...

604
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,930
-爆炸蓝莓  -那是什么
- Kablooie. - What's that?

605
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,790
糖果  阿斯加德有糖果吗
Candy. Do you have candy on Asgard?

606
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,400
有  葡萄  坚果
Yeah. Grapes, nuts.

607
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,310
怪不得你这么哀怨
No wonder you're so bitter.

608
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,850
好了  爆炸蓝莓只在地球特定地区有卖
Okay. Kablooie was only sold regionally on Earth

609
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,730
时间是从2047年到2051年
from 2047 to 2051.

610
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,970
我们只需要把它与所有天启事件交叉对照
All we gotta do is cross-reference that with every apocalyptic event.

611
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,030
我分你一半
I'm gonna give you half.

612
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,160
我们来比比看  谁先找到
And let's make it a competition, see who finds it, ok?

613
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,820
-好  -要赌点什么吗
- Sure. - You wanna bet something?

614
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,240
-好  -君子赌约
- Yeah. - Gentleman's bet.

615
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,830
为骄傲而战吧  祝最厉害的人取胜  开始
Yeah, let's play for pride. Okay. May the best man win. Go.

616
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,950
找到了吗
Anything?

617
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,660
不是2048年的气候灾害
It's not the climate disaster of 2048.

618
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,730
也不是2051年的海啸
Or the tsunami of 2051.

619
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,670
快  快  快
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

620
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,870
2050年
2050.

621
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,590
燕子灭绝  是这个吗
The extinction of the swallow... Is that a thing?

622
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,750
彻底毁掉了生态系统
Completely screwed up the ecosystem.

623
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,190
印尼的喀拉喀托火山也在2049年喷发了
Krakatoa erupted in 2049 as well.

624
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,270
没有爆炸蓝莓
No Kablooie.

625
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,090
天啊  坏事一件接着一件  是不是
God, it's just one damn thing after another, isn't it?

626
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,440
-风暴  饥荒  火山  洪水  -找到了
- Cyclone, famine, volcanoes, floods... - Got him.

627
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,800
-他就在这里  -阿拉巴马  2050年
- That's where he is. - Alabama, 2050.

628
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,740
要是我不留神  你可能会抢了我的工作
You're gonna take my job if I'm not careful.

629
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,080
你想让我批准
You want me to approve

630
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,180
派一支全副武装的特遣部队去...
deployment of a fully-armed task force to...

631
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,340
-对  -时间异体可能的藏匿处
- Yeah. - ...the Variant's potential hiding spot?

632
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,370
阿拉巴马圣所山
Haven Hills, Alabama,

633
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,710
曾是罗克斯卡特所有的企业镇
corporate town owned by Roxxcart

634
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,160
被一场飓风摧毁
until it's wiped out by a hurricane.

635
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,720
食物供给那里全都有
All the food and supplies you need.

636
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,720
如果他喜欢的话
If he likes it,

637
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,310
他完全可以一次次地回去
there's no reason he can't keep going back

638
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,230
在那里扎营
and just camping out, over and over.

639
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,660
你的依据就是一个让你上次任务失败的
And this is all based on a theory from the Variant

640
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,780
-时间异体提出的理论  -对  他做得很好
- who just blew your previous mission? - Yeah, he's doing great.

641
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,610
莫比乌斯  作为你的朋友
Mobius, as your friend,

642
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,190
我必须告诉你  相信这个人可不是明智之举
I have to tell you that trusting this man is not a good idea.

643
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,470
是啊  我知道  但也许他值得一试
No. I know. But maybe he's worth the trouble.

644
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,080
他发现了我们安保的一个巨大漏洞
He just uncovered a huge hole in our security.

645
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,430
我就是担心这个
That's what concerns me!

646
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
我能应付他  相信我
I can handle him. Trust me.

647
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,750
我们肯定能在这里抓住他
This is where we get our guy.

648
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,370
你  我信得过  但是他
You, I trust, but him.

649
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,480
听着  萝雯娜  我的直觉告诉我
Listen, Ravonna, every instinct is telling me

650
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,250
我们能在这里抓住时间异体
this is where we nail the Variant.

651
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,400
拜托  我这样激动可不多见  对不对
Come on. You don't see me usually this worked up, right?

652
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,960
我很兴奋
I'm excited.

653
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,960
我已经迫不及待了
I'm chomping at the bit.

654
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,590
-好吧  -好
- Okay. - Yes. Okay.

655
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,730
-但是莫比乌斯  -怎么了
- But, Mobius? - Yeah?

656
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,060
如果不成功的话  我就帮不了你了
There's not much I can do if it doesn't work out.

657
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,810
时时刻刻
For all time.

658
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,250
永永远远
Always.

659
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,440
好
Okay.

660
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,110
我们可以行动了
We're on.

661
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,630
我们今天要大干一场
We are doing some good work today.

662
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,730
我也这么想
I thought so too.

663
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,280
我跟你讲  你要是真帮我们抓到这个时间异体
I'm tellin' you. You actually help us catch this Variant,

664
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,010
谁知道会怎样呢  朋友
and who knows, my friend.

665
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,690
足以见到时间守护者吗
What, good enough for a face-to-face with the Time-Keepers?

666
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,970
我可没这么说
I didn't say that.

667
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,500
-一步一步来  -好  一步一步来
- One step at a time. - All right. One step at a time.

668
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,490
-以防万一  -嗯  这些真是...
- Just in case. - Yeah, don't those feel...

669
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,060
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

670
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,650
集合汇报情况
Gather around for a briefing.

671
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,060
罗克斯卡特是一个该时代典型的超级商场
Roxxcart is a vast superstore common to the era.

672
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,670
其中包含很多拓展区域
It consists of a series of sprawling sections,

673
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,470
还有一个很大的仓库
including a large warehouse.

674
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,150
平民们将这个仓库
This warehouse is being used by

675
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,810
当作风暴避难所
civilians as a shelter tryin' to ride out the storm.

676
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,950
记住  这是十级天启事件
Remember, this is a class ten apocalypse.

677
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,880
时间异体不该知道我们来了
While the Variant shouldn't know we're coming,

678
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,850
他可能躲在任何地方  我们应假定他有攻击性
he could be hiding anywhere and should be considered hostile.

679
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,210
所以保持警惕
So stay alert.

680
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,750
每次攻击  时间异体都会偷取重置设备
Every time there is an attack, the Variant steals a reset charge.

681
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,180
他肯定有什么计划
He's planning something.

682
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,540
我们只是还不知道是什么
We just don't know what.

683
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,030
留意那些消失的设备
So keep an eye out for the missing charges,

684
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,990
如果发现一个洛基  就删除
and if you see a Loki, prune it.

685
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,050
最好是删了坏的那个
The bad Loki, preferably.

686
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,870
有发现吗
Anything?

687
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,350
还没有  继续搜
Nothing yet. Move out!

688
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,980
搞什么
The hell was that?

689
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,960
是我用魔法弄干了我的衣服
That was me using magic to dry my clothes.

690
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,170
这样我就不用像你们那样
So I don't announce myself

691
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,270
用湿嗒嗒的脚步声到处宣布自己的到来
with every squeaky footstep like the rest of you.

692
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,170
带上两支小队搜索风暴避难所
Take both teams and sweep the storm shelter.

693
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,330
-是  长官  -我和洛基
- Yes, ma'am. - Loki and I are gonna

694
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,860
去看看温室  我们回陈列室汇合
check out the Green House. We'll meet back at the showroom.

695
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,000
-不行  -不行
- No. - No?

696
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,230
你跟D90走  他得跟我一起
You go with D-90. He stays with me.

697
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,090
你说什...他在我监管之下
What are you talking... He's under my supervision.

698
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,850
这是我的外勤行动  莫比乌斯
This is my field op, Mobius.

699
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,710
如果他没有威胁
If he's not a threat,

700
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,570
-那倒还...  -他当然有威胁
- then it won't be... - Of course he's a threat.

701
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,250
-还记得时间剧院吗  -莫比乌斯
- Do you not remember the Time Theater? - Mobius...

702
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,160
所以他必须跟着我
That's why I want him with me.

703
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,710
你要是想回时管局
You are more than welcome to go back to the TVA 

704
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,470
向伦斯雷尔提起诉讼  随便你  但现在...
and litigate with Renslayer, but right now...

705
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,980
我们都来了  我们不回去
We're here. We're not going back.

706
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,650
-时间异体就在这里  -莫比乌斯  没事的
- The Variant is here. - Mobius, it's fine. It's fine.

707
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,840
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

708
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:10,130
我知道信任是要自己争取的  所以我会的
I understand I have to earn that, so, I will.

709
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,960
为什么不可信任的人倒很喜欢说"相信我"
Why is it the people you can't trust are always saying, "Trust me"?

710
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,960
行吧  这次可抓牢你的时间项圈
Okay, try to hang on to your Time Collar this time.

711
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,250
我们在陈列室汇合
We'll see you in the showroom.

712
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,920
-很高兴我能和你单独相处  -安静
- I am glad we're getting to spend this time together. - Quiet.

713
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,360
我们一开始可能有误...
I'm saying we got off on the wrong...

714
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,140
没事的  没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

715
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,250
你在干什么
What are you doing?

716
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,370
买绿植
Shopping for plants.

717
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,420
在暴风雨里
In this storm?

718
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,620
飓风大减价呢
It's a hurricane sale.

719
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,480
杜鹃花半折
Azaleas are half off.

720
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,750
这人会是你吗
Could that be you?

721
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,740
我可能还是会穿西装  但有可能
I mean, I probably would have worn a suit, but, yes, maybe.

722
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,510
他死了吗
Is he dead?

723
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,440
没有  他们一般都会活下来的
No. They usually survive.

724
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,210
那么
So,

725
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,700
你就是时管局叫来追捕我的笨蛋
you're the fool the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

726
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,350
你  是我吧
Me, I presume.

727
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,210
拜托  如果要说  也是你是我
Please. If anyone's anyone, you're me.

728
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,870
见到你很高兴
How nice to meet you.

729
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,170
过去的一小时内  风越来越大
For the past hour we have seen winds intensifying.

730
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,130
如果你们刚调到本台...
Again, if you're just tuning in...

731
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,550
看看包里有没有重置设备
Check the bags for the reset charges.

732
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,550
你们是联邦应急管理署的吗
You guys FEMA?

733
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,120
还是国民警卫队
National Guard?

734
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,950
他们中任何人都有可能
Could be any one of them.

735
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,430
如果你们有直升机  或者其他交通工具
Well, hey, if you got a 'copter or other transport,

736
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,940
那就该拿出来了
now is the time to use it.

737
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,280
这里还有女人和小孩  这天气可不是开玩笑的
We got women and kids, and that weather ain't playin'.

738
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,640
很抱歉  我们没有
No, I'm sorry. We don't.

739
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,330
那你们怎么过来的
Well, how the heck did you get here?

740
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,750
你干什么
What are you doing?

741
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,930
这些人很害怕
These people are scared.

742
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,270
他们快死了  是该怕
They're about to die. They should be scared.

743
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,700
不该怕我们
Okay. Not of us.

744
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,720
-长官  -冷静点
- Sir! - Take it easy.

745
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,510
怎么了
What is it?

746
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,350
是真的  是真的  是真的
It's real. It's real. It's real.

747
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,860
是真的  是真的  是真的
It's real. It's real. It's real.

748
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,480
魅术是个聪明的小把戏
Enchantment is a clever trick.

749
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,650
很怂包  有点业余  但很聪明
Cowardly, a bit amateur-ish, but clever.

750
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,610
几乎跟给时管局干活一样怂包
Almost as cowardly as working for the TVA.

751
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,430
我只为我自己干活
I'm working for me.

752
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,110
你真这么想吗
You really believe that, don't you?

753
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,720
没错
Yeah.

754
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,940
我还担心他们会发现一个更强的我呢
And here I was worried that they'd found a better version of me.

755
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,210
你们在找避难所吗
Hi, are you guys looking for the disaster shelter?

756
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,070
不是
No.

757
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,970
上帝保佑
Oh, bless.

758
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,890
你要叫你的小朋友们来帮忙吗
Are you going to call your little friends for help?

759
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,630
怎么了
What's the matter?

760
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,080
你不敢跟我面对面吗
You too scared to meet me face-to-face?

761
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,090
现身吧
Show yourself.

762
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,510
获得他们的信任绝非易事
You know, gaining their confidence was no mean feat.

763
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,710
天啊
Oh, my God.

764
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,220
你是卧底
You went undercover.

765
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,550
如果你能暂时收起你的奉承话
If you could possibly sheathe your smarm for a moment,

766
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,660
我有个提议给你  所以我才来找你
I have an offer for you. That's why I found you.

767
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:40,810
说吧
Go on.

768
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,490
我要推翻时间守护者
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

769
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:50,750
我把话挑明了
And, uh, cards on the table,

770
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,610
我需要一个够格的副手
I could use a qualified lieutenant.

771
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,290
我猜你说的是...我
And I assume you mean... Me?

772
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,280
你怎么说
What say you...

773
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,050
洛基
Loki?

774
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,660
别这么喊我
Don't call me that.

775
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,940
你可以叫我...
You can call me...

776
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,490
兰迪
Randy.

777
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,820
天啊  现在我明白托尔为何觉得这很烦人了
God. Now I understand why Thor found this so annoying.

778
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,410
听着  别再玩游戏了  我一直在帮你
Listen. Enough with your games. I've been trying to help you.

779
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,200
我在文艺复兴集会拖延了他们好一阵
I kept them vulnerable at the Renaissance Fair for some time.

780
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,660
天啊  你人真好
Oh, gosh, and that was just so nice of you.

781
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,710
但经过八到十秒钟的考虑后
But after eight to ten seconds of consideration,

782
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,630
我的回答是  不
the answer is no.

783
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,800
我没兴趣统治时间变异管理局
I'm not interested in ruling the Time Variance Authority.

784
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,250
是真的  是真的
It's real. It's real.

785
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,170
是真的  是真的
It was real. It was real.

786
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,930
-什么是真的  什么...  -是真的
- What's real? What's... - It's real.

787
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,630
-她疯了  -是真的
- She's off the dial. - It's real.

788
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,280
-看着我  -是真的
- Look at me. - It's real.

789
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,790
我想回家
I wanna go home.

790
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,450
我们会送你回家
We're gonna get you there.

791
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,200
联系时管局  通知医务室...
Call the TVA, let the infirmary know...

792
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,450
不不  我泄密了
No, no, no. I gave it away.

793
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,750
-我泄密了  -你泄了什么密
- I gave it away. - What did you give away...

794
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,530
时间守护者  他们的所在
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

795
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,520
我泄漏了找到他们的方法
I gave it away how to find them.

796
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,290
B15  你情况如何
B-15, what is your status?

797
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,470
B15  请回复  你情况如何
B-15, come in. What's your status?

798
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,440
B15  能收到吗
B-15, do you copy?

799
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,580
如果你不想统治时管局  那你想要什么
If you don't wanna rule the TVA, then what do you want?

800
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,720
不重要  你来得太迟了
It doesn't matter. You're too late.

801
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,720
我想你会发现我是来得早才对
I think you'll find I'm well ahead of schedule.

802
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,590
我弹指间就找到了你的藏身处
I found your hiding place like that.

803
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,850
所以我是更厉害的洛基  你同意吗
I'd say that makes me the superior Loki, wouldn't you?

804
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,970
原来如此  这就是你的计划
I see. That's your plan.

805
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,090
把我们全引来这里  好炸毁这地方
Lure us all here so you can blow the place up.

806
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,630
我想兰迪了
I miss Randy.

807
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,160
谢谢你帮我拖延时间
Thank you for helping me stall for time.

808
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,360
你真的很喜欢听自己说话
You really do love to hear yourself talk.

809
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,950
你是第一个跟我说这话的人
You're the first person to tell me that.

810
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,750
什么
What?

811
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,400
我绝不会这样对待我
I would never treat me like this.

812
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,510
出来啊  别躲了
